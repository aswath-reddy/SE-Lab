Answer: The abstract is a concise summary of the Campus Event Management System project's goals, problem it solves, and key features.
The system aims to streamline the organization and participation in college events. Key functions include event creation, user registration, scheduling, real-time notifications, and offering an intuitive interface for students, faculty, and administrators. The goal is to improve event attendance, communication, and management efficiency across campus activities. 
b. Functional Requirements
Answer: Functional requirements define the specific actions the system must perform.
These requirements describe the system's core capabilities and features, detailing what the software should do. For this system, they would include: 
Allowing users (students, faculty, administrators) to register and log in. 
Enabling administrators and faculty to create, edit, and manage events, including scheduling and details.
Providing a mechanism for students to browse and register for events.
Implementing real-time notification functionality to inform users about event updates.
Facilitating data processing for inputs, outputs, and user interactions. 
c. Non-Functional Requirements
Answer: Non-functional requirements specify quality attributes and constraints of the system.
These requirements focus on operational characteristics rather than specific functions. They often relate to the "ilities" such as reliability, availability, security, and usability. For this system, they would include: 
Performance: Ensuring the system can handle a specific number of concurrent users during peak registration periods. 
Security: Implementing robust data protection for user information and event data. 
Usability: Providing an intuitive interface that is easy for all user types to navigate and use efficiently.
Reliability: Ensuring the system is available and operational during scheduled event management times. 
d. Identification of Users
Answer: The primary users of the system are students, faculty, and administrators.
The system is designed to cater to the different roles and needs of these specific user groups. 
Students: Primarily use the system for browsing events, registration, and receiving notifications.
Faculty: Use the system for creating and managing specific departmental or course-related events.
Administrators: Have high-level access to oversee all campus events, manage users, and ensure overall system efficiency.
